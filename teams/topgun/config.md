#Code#

We modified the code for TFT Display and were able to make a fighter jet and 5 missiles going towards it. The Fighter jet is controlled using a joystick to dodge the missiles. As the display screen was small and there was a delay in its execution. We modified the VGA example code but there was an error in the color display. When we give it black color it was still red. We try to resolve this by changing the VGA Displays but the error still occurred a different color and a different color was displayed. But if we hold the connects then the error doesn't occur. So we hope to configure this error caused due to loose connection using a VGA Adapter. The code for TFT Display is attached.
